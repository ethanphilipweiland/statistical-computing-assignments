# statistical-computing-assignments
This repository contains my assignments for STAT-S 610: Statistical Computing taken at Indiana University Bloomington in Fall 2022. This graduate-level course was taught by Professor Julia Fukuyama. The course was split into two parts. The first part focused on foundational programming principles and in the earlier assignments I tackle issues around loops, regular expressions, debugging, version control (see the STAT-S-610-Homework-5 repository) and other topics. The second part of the course focused on common statistical algorithms, and in the later assignments I tackle Newton-Raphson, Expectation Maximization, Accept-Reject, Approximate Bayesian Computation, and other algorithms. As this is for a statistics course, all of the code is written in R. Each assignment folder contains the assignment instructions, code, and write-up (if required).
